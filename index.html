					<h2>UM Intelligent Ground Vehicle</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="p1content">
					<p>UMIGV is a student run organization pioneering robotics and autonomous driving at the University of Michigan. In my work on system controls, I researched concepts and application of autonomous driving , working with the C++ Robotic Operating System (ROS) library to design a prototype vehicle. I am currently taking part in pioneering the software architecture for a autonomous vehicle, enabling the base to communicate with the sensors, and allowing for real-time data analysis. <br><br>

					<h2>LEDSense</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="p2content">
					<p>LEDsense is a project developed during MHacks 9, an annual hack-a-thon at the University of Michigan. LEDsense collects data from audio files to determine a light pattern customized to the music. After being given microcontrollers with built in LED's, we had the idea to synchronize the lights to audio data. Using a program we coded in MATLAB, we analyzed audio files and calculated timestamps where the largest changes in frequency occurred. The program generated a C++ sketch we were able to upload onto the microcontrollers. The final product was battery powered and stable enough to be used in poi-based performance. <br><br>

					<h2>SchedUM</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="p3content">
					<p>I created a web interface using CSS, html, and Python for students to find classes to add to their schedule. The Web Scheduler utilized Python and Flask functionality to control website navigation and dynamically acquire and render requested class data from a University API. The scheduler allows users to browse for classes by term, school, subject, and course title. Features include class descriptions, enrollment count, interactive map of class locations from Google Maps API, and enlargement of text for accessibility purposes. <br><br>
					<b>NOTE: Currently under construction, pending permission to access new University of Michigan API.</b> <br>
